# ðŸ“’ How to start a Jupyter Notebook

Dear future me, I know you are going to forget â€” again â€” how to launch a Jupyter Notebook.  
So here's a quick guide, for you and for anyone else who stumbles upon this page.

## Step 1 â€” Create a project folder

Open the command prompt and create a new project folder.
Why? Because you donâ€™t want to install packages globally and risk breaking your other projects.  
Keeping things clean is your watchword (though it clearly doesn't apply to your desk right now).

```bash
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
```

## Step 2 â€” Create your virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
## Step 3 â€” Activate the virtual environment

On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
## Step 4 â€” Install Jupyter

```bash
pip install notebook
```
## Step 5 â€” Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Or, if you prefer Jupyter Lab:
```bash
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab
```

## Step 6 â€” Create the first notebook
To keep things organized, create a new folder (e.g., `notebooks`) at the same level as `venv` folder.

1. In the Jupyter interface, click **"New" â†’ "Folder"**
2. Rename the folder to something like `notebooks`
3. Enter the folder
4. Click **"New" â†’ "Python 3"** to create the first notebook!

Thatâ€™s it!
Good luck with your new project :)

P.S.
Don't forget to deactivate the environment when you're done:

```bash
deactivate
```
